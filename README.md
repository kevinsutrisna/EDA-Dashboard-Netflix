# EDA-Dashboard-Netflix
This project is a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization dashboard developed using Tableau, leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle and from API in CSV format and processed in Google Colaboratory. The dashboard provides an overview of Netflix’s content growth and strategy over time. It shows how the catalog expands, how the mix between series and movies changes, how content quality evolves based on IMDb scores, and where hidden high-quality titles can be found. Each KPI is supported by a trend view and a breakdown to explain both the overall direction and the underlying drivers.
